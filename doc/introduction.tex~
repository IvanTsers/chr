A local alignment of two similar sequences can be approximated as a
region flanked by long exact matches with at least one mismatch
between them. The use of enhanced suffix arrays for finding the exact
matches makes this approximation fast compared to an actual alignment.
This approach is used in programs for fast estimation of evolutionary
distances, such as \ty{andi}~\cite{hau15:and} and
\ty{phylonium}~\cite{kloe19:phy}. Although the latter has the option to
print homologies, it is not the primary scope of the program. In turn,
this function is essential for the workflow of the program
\texttt{fur}~\cite{hau21:fur}.

This \ty{alan} package, is an implementation of anchor-based search of
homologies.
